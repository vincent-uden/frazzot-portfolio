![The Sims 4 Plumbobs](/img/blog/blog_post_images/plumbobs.PNG)

After many years in the modding community, I have collected a few gold nuggets. They're listed by creator and separated into script/gameplay mods, CC (Alpha, MM, B&B and CAS). Use the 
quick-links below or just keep on scrollin' to read through it all! 

If you're new to playing with mods, welcome! I'd like to recommend you to read my blog post on how to install & manage mods, what a mod really is and what it consist of. You can find it 
[here](/blog_posts/guide_the_sims_4_modding)!

### Gampeplay mods / script mods
- ► [Master Controller Command Center, MCCC](https://deaderpool-mccc.com/#/) Despite the website looking a bit sus; don't worry! This is one of the most established script mods in the community.
It basically allows more detailed control over the game and its progression. You can control everything from the percentage of employment in the population to quickly change a NPCs outfit.
- ► [Wicked Whims](https://wickedwhimsmod.com/index) **Obs, this is an adult mod**, however you wish to interpret that.. It's absolutley fantastic when it comes to realistic gameplay. It adds
menstrual cycles, birth control, nudity/sex features and other cool things to explore. I can defenitley recommed trying it out if you're interested in a more dramatic sims-experience. Together
with MCCC, this makes sims a lot more interesting!
- ► [Basemental Drugs](https://basementalcc.com/adult_mods/basemental-drugs/) You probably guessed it, yet another **adult mod**. This mod adds alcohol, drugs and it's effects a bit more 
obvious to the game. Paired with Basemental Gangs this makes a whole new not-so-family-friendly game and it's exteremly entertaining to play with if you like drama and to "push the red buttons!"
- ► [More Cas Colums](https://www.patreon.com/posts/more-columns-in-27751117) This isn't technically a "script mod" since it's only a .pckage file. But it's gameplay changing! This mod gives you
the oppurtunity to extend the amount of columns with items shown in CAS to 3, 4 or 5 instead of 2. It may sound very little to be on this list with the gigantic projects above, but trust me; 
with 2000+ CC installed, you will be scrolling cas all day with only 2 colums.
- ► [UI Cheats Extension](https://www.patreon.com/posts/ui-cheats-v1-16-26240068) Yet another amazing mod from Weerbesu! This mod gives you easier access to the basic cheats in the game. For 
example,using the UI to fill your needs instead of opening the console and type each and every minuite. It's meant to make the gameplay faster and much simpler, because let's be honest; do 
you really play the game without testingcheats true and motherlode? Didn't think so. 
- ► [T.O.O.L](https://www.patreon.com/posts/80063395) Builder? Heads up, this one's for you! T.O.O.L, as in Take Objects Of Lot, is pretty much the MCCC for objects. This mod allows you to do 
some incredible things in build mode, like placing things outside your lot, rotating trees upside down, yeah you get the drill. Check out TwistedMexis tutorial 
[here](https://youtu.be/x4SXG3k34gI) to learn more. 
- ► [No Texting & Walking](https://www.patreon.com/posts/69655727) Another TwistedMexi life-saver for the historical simmers out there. This mod removes the random event of sims pulling out their 
phone mid-walking. It's absolutley game changeing if you're into storytelling or historical gameplay. As for TwistedMexis mods and updates, you can find everything on their 
[website](https://twistedmexi.com/).
- ► [Teleport Any Sim](https://sims4studio.com/post/72734) This mod, together with [Pose Player](https://sims4studio.com/thread/2617/andrews-studio) is a must-have for machinima creators and
story tellers. TAS adds a free statue to the game which you can, you guessed it, teleport any sim to. Queue up a animation or poses with the help of Pose Player and you can create the perfect 
shot for your stories. 
- ► [XML Injector](https://scumbumbomods.com/xml-injector) "*The XML Injector for The Sims 4 is a mod library to allow mods that would normally require a script for simple changes to instead use 
a custom snippet. The library provides the scripting, and the modder can release their mod without having to concern themselves with writing, compiling and maintaining a script.*" (According to the
official website of the mod.) As a player, you'll only need this mod if another mod requires it - but I found it great to have installed and prepared.

<span id="cc">There's a ton of fantastic script mods for every little detail out there, be creative and discover your needs - then find a mod to fix it!</span>

<QuoteBlock>
Two useful terms to be familiar with when searching for mods are **alpha** and **Maxis Match**. These refer to the style of CC, and origins (*pun intended lol*) from when TS4 was released and a 
lot of CC creators prefered the style of the previous games better. The term alpha was therefore used to refer to a more realistic looking style of CC as the previous games, and Maxis 
Match, or also called MM refered to the more stylized clay-like style of the Sims 4.

![Alpha vs Maxis Match](/img/blog/blog_post_images/alpha_vs_mm_2.PNG) 

<span id="cas_alpha">If you're looking for Alpha alternatives to some of the links above, I'll recommend a few of my favorite creators below as well!</span>

#### Create A Sim Items (Alpha)

- ► [Leah Lillith](https://www.thesimsresource.com/artists/Leah_Lillith/) Their haritstyles are top quality an look stunning with many pretty swatches. This used to be my go-to when I played
with alpha hairstyles.
- ► [Nightcrawler](https://www.thesimsresource.com/artists/Nightcrawler_Sims) A long time favourite who's been in the game even back in the Sims 3 days. Another go-to when it comes to hair!
- ► [Anto](https://www.thesimsresource.com/artists/Anto/) Yet another legendary alpha hair creator!
- ► [S-Club](https://www.thesimsresource.com/artists/S-Club) I'm just dropping the famous names right now, S-Club has been around for ages, and you can clearly see that in their awesome 
hairstyles.
- ► [Wingssims](https://www.thesimsresource.com/artists/wingssims/) Another creator who really knows how to make hair look good in alpha style. I'd recommend prioritizing their male hairstyles,
since they excceed most of the other alpha hairstyles you can find!
- ► [Busra-tr](https://www.thesimsresource.com/artists/busra-tr/) Busra-tr creates some of the most iconic looks when it comes to alpha clothing. There are over 1200 creations on their TSR page
and definitely something for everyone.
- ► [Elliesimple](https://www.patreon.com/elliesimple) A marvelous designer when it comes to alpha clothing. Unfortunatley it seem as if most of the items aren't for free, but if you have 
the oppurtunity to pay for someones creation, this is what you should pay for in my opinion!
- ► [ShakeProductions](https://www.thesimsresource.com/artists/ShakeProductions) Alpha shoes just hits different with Shake Productions, I can tell you that!
- ► [Sifix](https://www.thesimsresource.com/artists/Sifix2) If you're looking for alpha dresses, this is the place to go!

#### Build & Buy Items (Alpha)

## My top picks on modding websites

There're better and worse websites when it comes to dowloading files, that's for sure. To make it easier for you, I have collected my top picks and where I usually find all my mods in this 
list below.
- ► [The Sims Resource](https://www.thesimsresource.com/) A safe to use website with all kinds of CC, if you're looking for alpha mods, this is problaby the best place to look.
- ► [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/sims4) Lately curseforge has popped up as a popular platform to download TS4 mods on. It's very much like TSR, just not as well established yet, 
but the amount of creations increase daily!
- ► [Mod The Sims](https://modthesims.info/) This is an old school platform, but it still provides with a lot of quality free downloads, tutorials, help and modding discussions.
- ► [The Sims Catalog](https://thesimscatalog.com/sims4/) Another website, much like TSR.
- ► [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/) Tumblr is a kind of social media platform but also works as a blog and customizeable space. Many creators therefore use tumblr as pseudo websites and
home for their collection of creations.
- ► [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/) Pinterest is a great place to look for inspiration, many creators upload or link their tumblr blogs or websites here. I have also created a board
with pins of mods [here](https://pin.it/7ibxFII)!
- <span id="final_words">► [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/search) Many creators use the monthly donation and early access feature through Patreon. This is why the populairity of the platform is increasing and
many creators start their own pages there. </span>


## Final words

I'd like to interpose with a few final words before wrapping up this post. 

Let's not forget about the incredible amount of resources the modders put into these creations. EA stated in their [policy on mods](https://help.ea.com/en/help/the-sims/the-sims-4/mods-and-the-sims-4-game-updates/) 
in december 2022 that "*Mods must be non-commercial and distributed free-of-charge. Mods cannot be sold, licensed, or rented for a fee, nor can Mods contain features that would support monetary 
transactions of any type.*" altough they then added, "*...Mod developers may: Offer an early access incentive for a reasonable amount of time. After a reasonable early access period, all users 
must be able to access the Mods in full for free regardless of whether they donate.*". 

Therefore, if you have the opportunity to download a few nice mods from this list, let them know! Like, share, comment or maybe even consider donating something if you're able to. We're deeply
thankful for every bit of support!

As a final word; this list will eventually be updated, and if you have any sugesstions on how I can improve it - let me know! I hope this will come in handy for your modding adventures, thank 
you for reading!
