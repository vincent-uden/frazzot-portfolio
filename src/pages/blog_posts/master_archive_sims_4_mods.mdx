Get ready for a modding treat folks!

After immersing myself in the modding community for many years, I've gathered a treasure trove of fantastic finds. They're sorted
by creator and divided into script/gameplay mods and a generous selection of custom content (CC), including both Alpha and Maxis Match (MM) for both Create A Sim (CAS) and Build & Buy (B&B).

Whether you prefer to click through the quick-links below or enjoy a leisurely scroll, lets dive right into these modding marvels!

_And hey, a quick sidenote before we get started_; If you're new to modding, a warm welcome to you! I'd like to recommend you to read my
[blog post](/blog_posts/guide_the_sims_4_modding) on how to install & manage mods. There I'll take you through what a mod is, how it works and how to manage all the files.

Let's move on to treasure hunting!

### Gampeplay mods / script mods

- ► [Master Controller Command Center, MCCC](https://deaderpool-mccc.com/#/) Don't let the website's appearance fool you; this script mod is truly a masterpiece. Offering unparalleled control
  over the game and its progression, MCCC is a must-have. With this mod, you have the power to fine-tune every aspect, from adjusting employment rates within the population to swiftly updating
  an NPC's outfit.
- ► [Wicked Whims](https://wickedwhimsmod.com/index) **Please note that this is an adult mod, so use your discretion.**, However, if you're looking to inject some realistic features into your
  game, this mod is an absolute game-changer. It introduces elements like menstrual cycles, birth control, nudity, and intimate encounters, among other intriguing features. For those
  seeking a more dramatic and immersive Sims experience, Wicked Whims is a definite recommendation.
- ► [Basemental Drugs](https://basementalcc.com/adult_mods/basemental-drugs/) As you might have already guessed, **this mod also falls into the adult category**. It introduces a whole new
  dimension to the game by adding alcohol, drugs, and their effects in a more pronounced manner. When combined with Basemental Gangs, it creates a pretty captivating yet maybe less family-friendly
  Sims experience. If you're someone who enjoys the thrill of drama and pushing boundaries, this mod is an absolute blast to play with.
- ► [More Cas Colums](https://www.patreon.com/posts/more-columns-in-27751117) While not classified as a "script mod," this mod brings about significant quality of life changes, as it
  provides the option to expand the number of CAS item columns displayed to 3, 4, or even 5, instead of the standard 2. This seemingly small mod may not compare in scale to the colossal
  projects mentioned above, but trust me, when you have a whopping 2000+ CC items installed, you'll find yourself scrolling through CAS forever.
- ► [UI Cheats Extension](https://www.patreon.com/posts/ui-cheats-v1-16-26240068) Another fantastic creation by Weerbesu! This mod offers a convenient solution for accessing basic
  cheats within the game. With UI Cheats Extension, you can easily fulfill your Sims' needs and perform various actions right from the game's interface. No need to rely on the console and type in
  cheats manually. This mod aims to streamline gameplay, making it faster and simpler.
- ► [T.O.O.L](https://www.patreon.com/posts/80063395) Calling all builders out there, this one's for you! T.O.O.L, or Take Objects Of Lot, is like the MCCC equivalent for objects. With this mod,
  your creative possibilities in build mode become limitless. This mod allows you to do some incredible things in build mode, like placing things outside your lot or even rotating trees upside down!
  For a deeper dive into the mod's capabilities, be sure to check out TwistedMexi's [tutorial](https://youtu.be/x4SXG3k34gI) to learn more.
- ► [No Texting & Walking](https://www.patreon.com/posts/69655727) Another TwistedMexi life-saver for the historical simmers out there. This mod addresses a common frustration by removing the
  random occurrence of Sims pulling out their phones mid-walking. I found it very useful since I enjoy storytelling and historical gameplay. To explore more of TwistedMexi's creations and stay up
  to date with their latest creations, you can find everything on their [website](https://twistedmexi.com/).
- ► [Teleport Any Sim](https://sims4studio.com/post/72734) A Must-Have for Machinima Creators and Storytellers! When combined with [Pose Player](https://sims4studio.com/thread/2617/andrews-studio),
  it unlocks a world of possibilities for creating captivating scenes. TAS introduces a versatile teleportation statue that allows you to instantly transport any Sim to your desired location. With
  the assistance of Pose Player, you can queue up animations or poses, enabling you to capture the perfect shot for your stories.
- ► [LittleMsSam](https://lms-mods.com/) I decided to link the whole website because I use a lot of mini-mods from this creator! Some of my personal favourites: _ChooseYourRoomates, Scarlet_FasterHomework
  (Uni/GradeHighSchool) and Scarlet_SubjectHomework_! Check them out and read more about various small mods like these on their website.
- ► [XML Injector](https://scumbumbomods.com/xml-injector) This ingenious tool allows mod creators to make simple changes without the need for complex scripting. Instead, they can utilize custom
  snippets provided by the mods library. With XML Injector, modders can focus on releasing their mods without the burden of writing, compiling, and maintaining a script.

As a player, you'll only require this mod if another mod specifically calls for it. However, I've found it to be a valuable addition to my own modding setup. It ensures that I won't break my game
if I accidentally didn't catch the requirement for a mod.

<span id="cc">
  *From small details to game-changing features, there's pretty much a mod out
  there to fulfill every need!*

  When exploring mods, it's helpful to be familiar with two key terms: "Alpha"
  and "Maxis Match." These terms describe different styles of CC in The Sims 4.
  "Alpha" refers to a more realistic-looking CC style that reminds of the
  previous Sims games style. On the other hand, "Maxis Match" (or "MM")
  represents a stylized, clay-like aesthetic that aligns with The Sims 4's
  regular visuals. Understanding these terms will assist you in finding CC that
  suits your preferred style!

## My top picks on modding websites

There are better and worse websites when it comes to downloading files, that's for sure. To make it easier for you, I have compiled my top picks and the places where I typically find all my
mods in the list below.

- ► [The Sims Resource](https://www.thesimsresource.com/) A reliable website offering a wide range of CC. If you're in search of alpha mods, this is likely the best place to find them.
- ► [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/sims4) This platform has gained popularity as a hub for TS4 mods. While not as established as TSR, it continues to grow with new creations added daily.
- ► [Mod The Sims](https://modthesims.info/) An old-school platform that still provides a plethora of high-quality free downloads, tutorials, and modding discussions.
- ► [The Sims Catalog](https://thesimscatalog.com/sims4/) Similar to TSR, this website offers a diverse collection of CC.
- ► [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/) A unique blend of social media and blogging, Tumblr serves as a popular space for creators to showcase their collections and customize their pages.
- ► [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/) An excellent source of inspiration, where creators often share links to their Tumblr blogs or websites. I have curated a board with pins of mods for your
  convenience. You can check it out [here](https://pin.it/7ibxFII)!
- <span id="closing">
    ► [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/search) Many creators utilize Patreon
    for monthly donations and early access to their content. This platform's
    popularity is on the rise, with more creators establishing their own pages
    there.{" "}
  </span>

## Closing thoughts

I'd like to share a few closing remarks before concluding this post.

It's important to acknowledge the tremendous effort modders put into creating these amazing creations. In December 2022, EA stated in their [policy on mods](https://help.ea.com/en/help/the-sims/the-sims-4/mods-and-the-sims-4-game-updates/)
that "_Mods must be non-commercial and distributed free-of-charge. Mods cannot be sold, licensed, or rented for a fee, nor can Mods contain features that would support monetary transactions
of any type._" However, they also added, "_...Mod developers may: Offer an early access incentive for a reasonable amount of time. After a reasonable early access period, all users must be
able to access the Mods in full for free regardless of whether they donate._"

Therefore, if you have the opportunity to download some of these fantastic mods from the list, show your appreciation to the creator! Like, share, comment, or perhaps even consider making a
donation if you're able to. We are sincerely grateful for every bit of support!

As a final note, this list will be periodically updated, and I welcome any suggestions on how to improve it. I hope it proves helpful on your modding adventures. Thank you for reading!
