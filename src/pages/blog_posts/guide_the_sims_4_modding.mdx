There's an absolutely gigantic jungle out there with mods and custom content for The Sims 4. But how does it all work, and how do we download mods? Today, I'll do my very best to explain 
it all to you!

## What is a mod?

So, what exactly is a mod? Well, a mod is a shortened term for modification. In our case, it specifically refers to modifying a game. Users, who aren't developers, make these modifications 
to change the appearance or function of the game. The level of ease when it comes to modifying games can vary but usually it's easier to modify single-player experiences. Games like The Sims, 
Skyrim, Fallout, and Minecraft are famous for their passionate modding communities and the vast assortment of mods and add-ons available. 

## Mods in The Sims 4

Now, let's talk about mods in The Sims 4. When it comes to modding, The Sims series has always been quite user-friendly, especially The Sims 4. However, there are a few things you need to 
keep in mind. So, without further ado, let's dive right in!

### Location

First things first, you'll need a designated folder for the mods to be saved in. This allows the game to read and 
utilize the mod files. When you install the game, there are two important locations: your **game folder** and your **data folder**. These locations are often separate because you decide where to 
install the game on your computer, but you don't have control over where all the data is saved. The most common location for the data files is as follows:

*Documents/​Electronic Arts/​The Sims 4*

In this directory, you'll find everything from cache files to mods, screenshots, and save files. So, when it comes to downloading mods, this is the only location you need to concern yourself 
with.

To keep things organized, create a new folder in this directory and name it **"Mods."** This folder will serve as the central place to store all your downloaded mods. Feel free to further organize 
this folder by creating sub-folders to categorize your content. Doing so will come in handy when you need to locate specific mods or clean out ones you no longer want.

**Note,** After running the game with a mods folder, the game will automatically generate a file called "Resource.cfg." This file tells your game how many folders deep it should search for your
mods. It allows for up to five nested folders inside your "Mods" folder. If, for some reason, this file goes missing, don't worry! Running your game again will usually recreate it.

However, if you find yourself not receive this file, head over to [this](https://help.thesimsresource.com/article/37-the-sims-4-resource-cfg-file) website and simply download a new one.

### File Types

In The Sims 4, there are two different file types that the game reads as mods: **.package** and **.ts4script**. Additionally, there are .txt and .cfg files that often come with mods.

#### .TS4SCRIPT

A .ts4script file is an archive that contains a .PY script (*python*). It is commonly used to add or modify interactions, animations, and menus in the game. Mods with .ts4script files are 
usually compressed into zip files. To install them, you need to unzip the file and place it directly into the mods folder. However, since these files modify the game's data, you must grant 
the game access to run them. This can be done by enabling custom content and mods in the Game Options menu under "Other." Once enabled, save your changes and restart the game.

#### .PACKAGE

On the other hand, .package files are the standard format for custom content (CC). These files typically include new items like clothes, hairstyles, furniture, and objects. They can be 
organized within the Mods folder, allowing for up to five nested folders. Unlike .ts4script files, .package files usually have a lighter impact on the game and do not alter existing game 
features.

#### .TXT/.CFG

In addition to the mods themselves, many mods come with accompanying **.txt** and **.cfg** files. .txt files may contain logs or information about the mod, while .cfg files serve as configuration 
settings for the mods. As previously mentioned, The Sims 4 automatically generates the "Resource.cfg" file when launching the game after you create the mods folder. Just like this file, mods 
.cfg files are also created when you launch the game. **If you delete a .cfg file, all the associated settings for that mod will be lost.**

So, when installing mods and custom content for The Sims 4, keep these file types in mind and ensure they are placed correctly in the designated folders. &nbsp;

Lastly, remember to keep your mods updated, especially script mods after bigger game updates, you'll also have to re-enable Custom Content and Mods in the game options menu.
