There's an absolutely gigantic jungle out there with mods and custom content for The Sims 4. But how does it all work, and how do we download it? Today, I'll do my very best to explain
it all to you!

## What is a mod?

So, what exactly is a mod? Well, a mod is a shortened term for modification. In our case, it specifically refers to modifying a game. Users, who aren't developers, create these modifications
to change the appearance or function of the game. The level of ease when it comes to modifying games can vary but usually it's easier to modify single-player experiences. Games like The Sims,
Skyrim, Fallout, and Minecraft are famous for their passionate modding communities and the vast assortment of mods and add-ons available.

## Mods in The Sims 4

Now, let's talk about mods in The Sims 4. When it comes to modding, The Sims series has always been quite user-friendly, especially The Sims 4. However, there are a few things you need to
keep in mind. So, without further ado, let's dive right in!

### Location

First things first, you'll need a designated folder for the mods to be saved in. This allows the game to read and
utilize the mod files. When you install the game, there are two important locations: your **game folder** and your **data folder**. These locations are often separate because you decide where to
install the game on your computer, but you don't have control over where all the data is saved. The most common location for the data files is as follows:

_Documents/​Electronic Arts/​The Sims 4_

In this directory, you'll find everything from cache files to mods, screenshots, and save files. So, when it comes to downloading mods, this is the only location you need to concern yourself
with.

To keep things organized, create a new folder in this directory and name it **"Mods."** This folder will serve as the central place to store all your downloaded mods. Feel free to further organize
this folder by creating sub-folders to categorize your content. Doing so will come in handy when you need to locate specific mods or clean out ones you no longer want.

  **Note,** After running the game with a "Mods" folder, the game will
  automatically generate a file called "Resource.cfg." This file tells your game
  how many folders deep it should search for your mods. It allows for up to five
  nested folders inside your "Mods" folder. If, for some reason, this file goes
  missing, don't worry! Running your game again will usually recreate it.

However, if you find yourself without this file, head over to [this](https://help.thesimsresource.com/article/37-the-sims-4-resource-cfg-file) website and simply download a new one.

### File Types

In The Sims 4, there are two different file types that the game reads as mods: **.package** and **.ts4script**. Additionally, there are .txt and .cfg files that often come with mods. I'll also
briefly cover files extensions you could stumble upon when downloading sims and lots.

#### .TS4SCRIPT

<LeftStack masterWidth="45%">

A .ts4script file is an archive that contains a .PY script (_python_). It is commonly used to add or modify interactions, animations, and menus in the game.

Mods with .ts4script files are usually compressed into zip files. To install them, you need to unzip the file and place it directly into the "Mods" folder. However, since these files modify
the game's data, you must grant the game access to run them. This can be done by enabling custom content and mods/script mods in the Game Options menu under "Other." Once enabled, save your
changes and restart the game.

#### .PACKAGE

On the other hand, .package files are the standard format for custom content (CC). These files typically include new items like clothes, hairstyles, furniture, and objects. They can be
organized within the "Mods" folder, allowing for up to five nested folders. Unlike .ts4script files, .package files usually have a lighter impact on the game and do not alter existing game
features.

**Fun fact!** Have you ever wanted to personalize the music in The Sims 4? Well, here's a cool trick for you! You can actually add your own custom music to play on the stereos in the game. 
Here's how you can do it:

1. Locate the Documents/​Electronic Arts/​The Sims 4/Custom Music folder on your computer.
2. Add your .mp3 files to one of the pre-exsisting categories within the "Custom Music" folder.
3. Once added, the game will automatically integrate your songs with the existing music library.

#### .TXT/.CFG

In addition to the mods themselves, many mods come with accompanying **.txt** and **.cfg** files. .txt files may contain logs or information about the mod, while .cfg files serve as configuration
settings for the mods. As previously mentioned, The Sims 4 automatically generates the "Resource.cfg" file when launching the game after you create the "Mods" folder. Just like this file, mods
.cfg files are also created when you launch the game. **If you delete a .cfg file, all the associated settings for that mod will be lost.**

#### Sims, lots and the mighty Tray folder

If you've ever come across a folder named "Tray" within your Sims 4 documents folder, you might have initially felt a bit intimidated and closed it right away. But fear not! This folder is
where all your library's Sims and Lots are stored. Deleting them from this folder will make them disappear from your library, so I strongly advise against deleting them directly from here.

Now, you may be wondering, what do Tray files have to do with modding? Well, if you've ever come across a beautifully designed house or an exceptionally attractive Sim
(_[cough, cough](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sims4/comments/11e95e6/goth_family_remake/)_) that you'd love to have in your game, you'll need more than just custom content (CC) to bring them into
your world. To do this, you'll require a few additional files, which may have the following extensions:

<QuoteBlock>
  - ► **.trayitem** - ► **.householdbinary** - ► **.blueprint** - ► **.room** -
  ► **.bpi**
</QuoteBlock>

All of these files should be placed directly into the "Tray" folder, without any sub-folders. Once you launch your game, the Sims and Lots should appear in your library. And don't forget
to download any necessary CC as well!

### Summary

Fantastic! Just remember to keep these file types in mind and ensure they are correctly placed in the designated folders when installing mods and custom content for The Sims 4. Now,
let's quickly recap before wrapping up.
