This year I’m turning twenty-five. It feels odd, not just literally but spiritually. As if time is moving forward but I’m standing still. I never thought it would feel like _this_. 
Twenty-five always sounded like the age where things clicked into place: a career direction, a decently decorated flat, maybe even some sense of stability. Instead I feel suspended 
somewhere between who I was at fifteen and who I thought I’d be by now.

I hold on to my most peaceful moments, then and now. Late nights with lukewarm tea at the corner of my desk. Skyrim soundtracks looping endlessly in my headphones. The pale blue 
light of my monitors burning into my eyes. My right wrist aching from drawing in the same position for hours, but I don’t mind. I never did. That quiet rhythm of creating, existing, 
being alone with myself—I wouldn’t trade it for anything.

And yet somehow, the older I get, the more fragile that peace feels. When I was younger, it was simply life. Now I worry it might slip away. That maybe this time will be _the last 
time_. That one day the noise of responsibility and the chaos of adulthood will drown it out for good.

Life at twenty-five is hectic. I’m studying a full-time computer engineering degree while throwing myself into student unions and committees. My calendar is always full. There’s 
always another project, another deadline, another person asking for a piece of me. And I like it. I like being in motion, I like keeping my hands busy. Still, sometimes I stop 
and wonder: am I chasing life, or is life chasing me?

The truth is, I’ve always been a dreamer. I have too many interests, too many versions of myself I want to explore. Engineer, artist, activist, writer, builder. I don’t have enough 
human in me to contain it all. I only ever manage a fraction of what I imagine, and still I can’t stop reaching for more. It’s frustrating, tiring, overwhelming. And still, I 
wouldn’t trade it. Because even if the burden of dreaming is heavy, it means I’m never empty.

Sometimes, when I think about all the directions I could go, it feels like I’ve stumbled into Matt Haig’s _Midnight Library_. In the book, every possible version of Nora’s life 
waits on a shelf. Each one a different choice, a different outcome. That image haunts me, because I often feel the same. Every project I start, every dream I carry, feels like a 
book I’ve half-pulled from the shelf. I flip through a few pages before rushing to the next.

The dreamer in me wants to live them all. The life where I’m a full-time artist. The life where I’m an engineer building something world-changing. The life where I disappear into 
travel, or writing, or music. I feel greedy for them, as if not choosing is safer than closing a book forever.

Of course I know, as _The Midnight Library_ reminds me, that no one can live every life. The shelves will always stretch on infinitely. And the more we stare at them, the less 
we notice the one life actually open in our hands. Maybe that’s what I’m still learning at twenty-five. Not how to choose the “perfect” life, but how to sit with the one I’m 
already in, and give it the attention it deserves.

Here’s where some of my tension lies. Somehow it always felt like I was supposed to have things figured out by now. I’ve tried on different lives already—different jobs, 
different studies, stretches of unemployment, seasons of being endlessly busy and seasons of doing almost nothing. And yet I always find myself restless. Always craving the 
next thing. Always chasing the fear of standing still, dressed up as dissatisfaction or perfectionism.

Stagnation scares me more than failure. Perhaps because failure still means movement. You tried, you learnt, you shifted. I had to accept that when I first got sick. There 
was no beauty in it, no way to dress it up, no excuse for what I’d lost. I had to quit school and rest for months. I felt like a total failure, stripped of direction, as if 
the world was carrying on without me. But I didn’t stay there. Because stagnation feels like disappearing quietly into nothing. So I keep moving, piling my life with things, 
afraid that if I stop, I’ll realise I don’t know where I’m going. And I don’t ever want to find myself back there again.

But here’s the question I keep circling back to: what does it really mean to have life “figured out”? Is it a job title? A relationship? A steady rhythm? Is it the absence of 
longing, or the ability to live with longing without letting it consume you?

It’s so easy to get swept up in the rhythm of everyday life. Making sure the laundry is done, the dishes aren’t piling up, the emails are answered, the flat kept just clean 
enough to function. Those little routines become the shape of the days, and sometimes I forget to look beyond them.

And then something snaps me out of it.

A few weeks ago, my grandmother fell and hurt herself. I already felt guilty for not visiting her more often. But when I finally took a day off and went to the hospital, 
everything else faded. For seven hours, nothing existed outside that room. Not my studies, not the committees, not the endless list of things I think I need to keep in order. 
Just the sterile smell of disinfectant in the air, the hum of cars moving through their own routines outside, the ticking clock on the wall, and her warm hand in mine.

I felt fragile, grateful, and scared all at once. My mind filled with memories—our trips together, afternoons in her garden, the hours she patiently taught me to paint and weave. 
Those moments came back in vivid detail, as if they were right there with us in the hospital. And somewhere in all that remembering, the busyness and ambitions of my current life—the constant feeling of not doing enough—just dissolved.

It made me realise how lucky I am to feel this deeply. To have a family that grounds me. To be shaped by love and care. And maybe that’s the real point: that everything I am, 
everything I’ve tried, everything I’ll ever become—it only matters because of the people and moments that make it all feel alive.

I don’t have the answer to any of these questions or thoughts. But I do know this: whenever I feel lost, I return to those small anchors of peace. To the late nights, the tea, 
the music, the drawing, and the people who make me feel like _home_. To the quiet reminder that even at fifteen, even at twenty-five, even at seventy someday, maybe those simple 
rituals are the truest version of myself.

Maybe “figuring it out” isn’t about solving life like an equation. Maybe it’s about building small spaces where peace can still find you, even as the rest of life swirls around 
in chaos. And maybe part of that peace comes with growing older, realising you don’t always have to prove yourself to the world. At twenty, everything felt like a performance. 
But at twenty-five, I find myself circling back to the things I loved at ten. Barbie films, fantasy princesses, the unapologetic joy of being soft and silly without explanation.

And if I can still find peace in the same ways I did a decade ago, whether in drawing late at night or in daydreams that make me smile—then maybe I’m not lost after all. Maybe 
I’m just still wandering. And perhaps wandering is exactly what twenty-five is meant to be, as long as I keep hold of those anchors— tea, the drawing, the people I love, the 
warm hand in mine.
