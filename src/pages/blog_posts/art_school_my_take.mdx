First and foremost, hello and welcome to my blog. This is my first post and I’m beyond excited to get things started around here.
We’ve been working on this website for roughly a year now, and I’d love to hear some feedback and thoughts on it. As always, you
can reach out to me through [email](/contact), or my other social platforms.

For now though, lets move on to todays topic - art school.

  The purpose of arts education is not to produce more artists, though that is a
  byproduct. The real purpose of arts education is to create complete human
  beings capable of leading successful and productive lives in a free society.

Although this is not a lecture on how to navigate the important aspects of life, I believe it's essential that we remain humble and
recognize that knowledge should not be used as a coping mechanism for a lack of self-awareness. Being titled as an "artist" in itself
won't necessarily make you happier; it's what you create with the knowledge acquired alongside the title — it's so much more than
money and status.

### A brief backstory

In April 2021, I applied for the "Game Creator Artist" programme at Yrgo, one of many trade schools in Sweden. This programme aimed
to provide a more practical approach to art, specifically tailored to the game industry. It promised a significant share of job
opportunities after graduating. [Statistics](https://www.scb.se/hitta-statistik/statistik-efter-amne/utbildning-och-forskning/befolkningens-utbildning/intradet-pa-arbetsmarknaden/pong/statistiknyhet/intradet-pa-arbetsmarknaden-efter-yrkeshogskolan/) from SCB stated that over 90 percent of the people who
graduated from Swedish trade schools in 2021 were primarily working within a year after
graduating. And surely enough, I was offered a full-time job six months before graduating as a 3D generalist.

On top of that - Swedish education is financed largely by tax revenue. This means that tuition fees are fully paid for students
from Sweden, the EU/EEA area, and Switzerland according to [this article](https://sweden.se/work-business/study-research/higher-education) on sweden.se. Considering all of these perks, going to art
school wouldn't be the end for me if I decided not to continue down that path. Which I sort of didn't do, but we'll get to that later.

_To give you a brief overview of my experience, I'll recap my years as a student first._

The first five months focused on 2D art. We studied courses that covered topics like colour theory, croquis (_anatomy_), pixel art,
2D animation, concept art, style studies, and so on. The focus was more on the practical aspects of creating artwork and presenting
it in a portfolio, rather than deeply understanding the underlying concepts and techniques.

What I didn't understand at the time was how heavily 3D-focused it would be. I had pretty much negligible experience in 3D,
and what I meant to apply for was to "draw more". It may sound rather silly, but **I craved to express my creativity, not to make a
career out of my passion.**

However, five months in. With our first seven-week game project completed, I started to get the hang of things and where this
would take me. During the spring term, we learned ZBrush, Blender, Houdini, Unity, and a range of 3D concepts. The final project
before our summer break was another game project. By then, I was pretty much done; I didn't want to create games — I still just
wanted to draw. I decided to take a break and go back to my chemE degree instead, or at least that's what I thought would happen.
After a rough period, I decided to finish my Game Art degree — I wasn't mentally at my finest during this period, maybe that's
understandable. With two terms to go, I had a course in Unreal Engine, a VR game project, my graduation project, and the internship
left. It was tough, but now one month after graduating — I'm so glad I pushed through it.

### Lessons learned

I learned a lot, met new friends, and got a part-time job. **But the most valuable lesson I learned was to hold myself accountable
for the decision I made when signing up for the programme. Being so close to quitting, I now understand that my hardship wasn't in
the education itself — but the fact that I didn't believe in myself.** I never believed that what I truly wanted to do was possible;
therefore, I mentally gave up. The very weird thing here is that I am already doing what I want. I am drawing, just not making a
living out of it — and honestly, it shouldn't even matter; money was never a part of that dream. As soon as the pressure of needing
to make money from my passion faded, I've felt so much better about it. I'm not saying I wouldn't want to; just that it's not
necessary for my happiness.

I was offered a full-time job at the beginning of my internship. The salary was decent, and the tasks were alright. But what put me
off was that I didn't expect it to feel like a job. It's my passion, shouldn't I have felt more excited about it? Unfortunately,
I don't think the draining aspects of work arise from boring tasks and lack of interest. For me, at least, it was the fact that I
would do it only for the money. Instead, I agreed to take the job part-time, hourly-based, and it felt a lot better.

I am still not sure what "my dream job" would be or anything like that. Probably because I don't believe in such things anymore.
It sounds rather gloomy, but I find it incredibly freeing. I'm focusing on exploring what gives me fulfillment, engages me, and
challenges me. It brings variation and colour to a dull lifestyle where everything could have been so predictable. I also believe that
it's alright to not love every aspect of your life. You should learn how to be content even if you'll remain a work-in-progress your whole
life.

### My advice regarding art schools

Of course, my mind isn't working like everyone else's, thankfully. And I'm glad there are other opinions to explore! With that said,
I have some advice if you're still trying to decide whether art school is something for you.

#### What kind of art school?

It's important to differentiate between classic fine arts and something like game art — the two aim toward
completely different career paths. According to the Wikipedia page on art school, historically it is separated into six definitive
curricula. Among those, the conceptual and professional curricula apply mostly to the modern art school. Fine arts and the classic
art university we refer to today usually fall into the conceptual curricula. Meanwhile, game art or more practical, applied
forms of art fall into the professional curricula. If you're interested in reading more about their differences, I'll refer you to
the article itself [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_school).

Then there are separate courses, part-time programmes, and so on. Explore your options and figure out which option would fit you the
best. If you're interested in learning 3D without taking a course, then Blender is an open-source, completely free program. There
are a lot of materials and tutorials online to get you started. That's definitely something I would recommend doing before deciding on
what to study, especially if you're unsure about 3D.

#### What's your goal with art school?

Take some time and ask yourself: _What's your goal in attending art school?_ The most rational choice
doesn't always have to be the right one; instead, consider what truly resonates with you. There's nothing wrong with aspiring to make
a substantial income, but it requires research of the employment situation, especially within artistic carreers. You may need to be
open-minded and willing to delve into new fields like technical art to secure higher-paying jobs. Conversely, if you're completely
certain about your artistic path, be prepared for hard work and potentially modest compensation. Take a look at typical Mangakas,
and you'll soon realize that money isn't everything for everyone.

#### What's your budget/current life situation?

I'm well aware of the advantage of having my tuition fees covered, and I understand that
not everyone has the same advantages. Undoubtedly, it greatly impacts the decision, because not everyone can afford it —
and that’s totally okay.

Luckily, the internet provides us with incredible amounts of information and everything taught in art school is accessible online; you
just need to know where to find it. There may be minor hurdles with subscriptions or literature, particularly in the 3D field. However,
we're fortunate that Blender offers most of what we need for free — bless open source! Try searching for free alternatives to programs
like Photoshop on Google, and you're likely to discover some great options. Libraries may also provide cheaper alternatives, like
borrowing books, but many resources can be found online at a lower cost or even for free.

If financial concerns are not a factor in your decision, then that's one problem resolved — excellent! However, no one can escape the
value of time. Time is incredibly precious, probably more so than money for most of us in this position. Devoting several
years of your life solely to obtain a diploma and a title is both misguided and disrespectful to yourself. Review your
responsibilities, weigh the pros and cons, and seek guidance or advice from people you trust.

Education holds great importance, and we should cherish knowledge and utilize it wisely. However, we should have more conversations
about the motives and reasons behind pursuing education. Just as not everyone needs formal culinary training to cook delicious meals,
not everyone needs to attend art school to become an artist.
