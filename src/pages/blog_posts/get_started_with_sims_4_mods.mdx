There's an absolute gigantic jungle out there with mods and custom content for The Sims 4. Today I'm going to try my very best to explain how it all works, I'll wrap it up with a
list of go-to mods I adore right now.

## What is a mod?

Mod is a short term for modification, in our case it more specifically refers to the modification of a game. This is done by users (*non-developers*) in order to change the appearance or 
function of the game. Not all games are equally easy to modify, usually it requires a single player experience to add your own mods. Games like The Sims, Skyrim, Fallout and Minecraft are 
some famous titles a known for their passionate modding communites and saturated "markets" of mods and add-ons. 

## Mods in The Sims 4

Modding the sims games have always been fairly easy, especially The Sims 4. But there're a few things to keep in mind, we'll jump right into it!

### Location

To begin dowloading mods, you'll need a folder for them to be saved in order for the game to be able to read the files. When installing the game there's two important locations, your *game folder*
and *data folder*. They're often separated as you'll decide where to install the game on your computer, but not where all the data is saved. The following location is the most common 
location for the data files: 

*Documents/​Electronic Arts/​The Sims 4*

Here you'll find everything from cache files to mods, sceenshots save files and so on. **When downloading mods, this is the only location you need to bother with.** 

In this directory, create a new folder and name it **"Mods"**. In this folder you can place all your dowloaded mods. Feel free to organize this folder with sub-folders for your mods, 
I'll provide you with a great example of how to organize your mods. Having a organized modding folder is important if you need to locate broken mods or to clean out stuff you no longer want. 

*Obs, after running the game with a mods folder, the game will create a file called "Resource.cfg". It tells your game how many folders deep to read your mods and it ordinarily allows 
for up to 5 nested folders inside your Mods folder. If this file goes missing, running your game again will normally recreate it.* 

If you for some reason doesn't receive this file, head over to [this](https://help.thesimsresource.com/article/37-the-sims-4-resource-cfg-file) website and simply download a new one.

### File Types

There are two different file types the game can read, it's **.package** and **.ts4script**. 

A TS4SCRIPT file is an archive used by The Sims 4. It contains a .PY script, (*python*) which is typically used to add or overwrite interactions, animations and menus in the game. As they alter 
the game data files, you'll need to grant access to the game for them to run. This is done by enabling custom content and mods by selecting "Other" from the Game Options menu and checking the
"Enable Custom Content and Mods" box. After doing that, you'll need to save and restart the game to continue. 

These files are often used with .PACKAGE files and a
